From the Kickstarter data provided, **the most successful ventures** are plays, rock music, and documentary film. Film & video, music, and theater have the **highest amount of ventures**, and journalism, food, and games/photography have the **lowest amount of ventures**. Also, the month of **May had the most success** while the month of **July showed the most failures**. 

The given dataset a limitation is the **quantity** of data. There are about 4000 projects in the dataset, however, according to the [Kickstarter about page](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats), there are over 526,105 projects launched. So the patterns I observed from the data set are only a small sample size and will not be as accurate as a larger dataset. Another limitation is the **distinction and varieties** of subcategories. For example, it is a faint line between gadgets, hardware, and wearables. I would personally consider a smartwatch, to be all three sub-categories. 

If there is more information on successful ventures, better conclusions can be made. There is more to a successful venture than the pledged funding exceeding the goal; it must succeed and thrive after the kickstart phase. Also more geographically specific data could draw further conclusions. Perhaps most of the successful theater and film projects were in New York and California, and the failed projects were in other states.

Another graph that would be enlightening would be the average pledged funding per category and sub-category. Currently, we do not know what ventures get the most funding and there could be a correlation between funding and category. Also, it would be useful to visualize the successful ventures to the pledged funding. It would make sense if most of the failures had no funding at all, but it would be very useful for investors to know what high funded projects failed.



## Statistical Analysis:

The statistical analysis tells us that on average, successful projects gathered more backers. However, with an extremely large standard deviation, potential outliers are likely skewing the mean. The extremely large variance and standard deviation tell us that the successful project data is very far from the mean. So a few ultra-successful projects that attracted the highest amount of backers skews the statistics. The failed project statistics have a smaller variance and much lower standard deviation, so most of the failed projects received a number of backers most similar to their mean. The median is a more sensible perspective of “middle-of-the-road” projects, disregarding extremely low or high outliers. Considering both the mean and median, and their limitations, successful Kickstarter projects still attract significantly more backers.
